# RÃ©aliser un site de suivi de patients pour un psychologue


### About Dataset
Context

     I was looking for a well labeled dataset to perform a multiclass classification. I wanted to do something more than just sentiment classification, there is more than positive, negative and neutral sentiment in a sentence. I wanted to identify the emotion behind the words written. I found various txt files but it was a pain to clean and arrange the data again and again just to perform a simple classification. So I decided to prepare a csv file from all those text files and here you are, looking for text data just like me. All the best!

     There are two columns, Text and Emotions. Quite self explanatory right. The Emotions column has various categories ranging from happiness to sadness to love and fear. Have fun building models which can identify what words denote what emotion.
